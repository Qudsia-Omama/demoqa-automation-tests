# 🧪 DemoQA UI Automation Tests

This repository contains a set of UI automation test scripts written in **Python** using **Selenium WebDriver**.  
The scripts target various components of the practice website [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com), allowing you to test form handling, alerts, frames, windows, waits, and more.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each Python file in this repo is a separate test or automation scenario:

| File Name              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `practiceForm.py`         | Automates input validation and submission for the practice form. |
| `switchtoalert.py`        | Handles JavaScript alerts (accept, dismiss, prompt). |
| `switchtoframe.py`        | Demonstrates switching between iframes. |
| `switchtowindow.py`       | Tests switching between multiple browser windows/tabs. |
| `switchtoactionchains.py` | Combines interaction handling with action chains. |
| `ActionChains.py`         | Performs drag-and-drop, hover, and other advanced actions. |
| `implicitWait.py`         | Uses Selenium's implicit wait to handle dynamic elements. |
| `twentyEight.py`          | Likely tests text box elements on the DemoQA form. |
| `pytest1.py`              | Basic example using the `pytest` framework. |
| `PracticeProg.py`         | General practice script (likely targeting form/text box input). |
